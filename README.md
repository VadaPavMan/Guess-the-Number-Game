This is a simple command-line game implemented in C where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game gives hints like "Higher number please" or "Lower number please" based on the player's guesses until the correct number is found.

## Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- Hints provided to guide the player based on the guessed number.
- Tracks the number of guesses it took to find the correct number.
- Input validation to ensure the user enters a valid number within the specified range.
